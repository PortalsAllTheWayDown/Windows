The file system used in modern versions of WIndows is the New Technology File System or NTFS.

Before NTFS, there was FAT16/FAT32(File Allocation Table) and HPFS(High Performance File System)

You still see FAT partitions in use today. Typically in USB devices, MicroSD cards.

NTFS is known as a journaling file system. In case of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on disk using information stored in a log file. This is not possible with FAT.

NTFS addresses many of the limitations of the previous file systems such as:
-Supports files larger than 4GB
-Set specific permissions on folders and files
-Folder and file compression
-Encryption(Encryption File System or EFS)

Some info from microsoft on this: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/backup-and-storage/fat-hpfs-and-ntfs-file-systems

On NTFS volumes, you can set permissions that grant or deny access to files and folders.

The permissions are:
-Full control
-Modify
-Read & Execute
-List folder contents
-Read
-Write

To view your permissions on a file or folder:
-Right click the file or folder you want to check for ppermissions.
-Select properties
-Witin properties, click on the security tab
-In the Group or User names list, select the user, computer or group whose permissins you want to view.

There is also special permissions 
-Change permissions
-Take ownership
There are others but these seem interesting.

NTFS has (ADS) or Alternate Data Streams

Alternate Data Streams is a file attribute specific to Windows NTFS

Every file has at least one data stream ($DATA) and ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data. 
Natively Window Explorer doesnt display ADS to the user. There are 3rd party
